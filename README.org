** Summary

MPDel is an Emacs client for [[https://www.musicpd.org/][Music Player Daemon]] (MPD), a flexible,
powerful, server-side application for playing music. MPDel provides an
Emacs user interface to control playback (play, pause, next, volume
up…) and to display and control the current playlist as well as your
stored playlists (e.g., "my favorites", "wake me up", "make me dance",
…).

This is a screenshot of the current playlist with the
currently-playing song:

[[file:media/mpdel-playlist.png]]

MPDel can show information about the currently playing song or any
other song:

[[file:media/mpdel-song.png]]

With the additional package [[https://gitlab.petton.fr/mpdel/ivy-mpdel.git][ivy-mpdel]], you can navigate your music
database and add songs to playlists with completion:

** Installing

Clone this git repository and [[https://gitlab.petton.fr/mpdel/libmpdel][libmpdel]]. I will ask to get MPDel inside
[[http://melpa.org/][melpa]].

You need to install and (quickly) configure an [[https://www.musicpd.org/][MPD server]] if you don't
have any yet. Don't worry, that's simple and you won't regret it.

** Using

Start by adding these lines to your ~init.el~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lib/libmpdel")
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lib/mpdel")
  (require 'mpdel)
  (mpdel-mode)
  (mpdel-setup)
#+END_SRC

Then, press ~C-x Z p~ to show the current playlist. The ~C-x Z~ global
prefix is configurable with ~mpdel-prefix-key~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mpdel-prefix-key (kbd "C-. z"))
#+END_SRC

*** Global key bindings

Anywhere in Emacs, if you activate ~mpdel-mode~, you have access to
a set of key bindings to control your music. The following key bindings
must all be prefixed by ~mpdel-prefix-key~'s value (~C-x Z~ by
default):

| *Binding* | *Action*                    |
|-----------+-----------------------------|
| ~SPC~     | play / pause                |
| ~S~       | display current song        |
| ~p~       | open current playlist       |
| ~P~       | open a stored playlist      |
| ~]~       | start playing next song     |
| ~[~       | start playing previous song |
