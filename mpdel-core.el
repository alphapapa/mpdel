;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides some common ground for all MPDel
;; user-interfaces.

;;; Code:

(require 'libmpdel)

(defvar mpdel-core-map
  (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
    (define-key map (kbd "SPC") #'libmpdel-playback-play-pause)
    (define-key map (kbd "M-n") #'libmpdel-playback-next)
    (define-key map (kbd "M-p") #'libmpdel-playback-previous)
    map)
  "Keymap for all mpdel buffers.")

;; Make it possible to activate `mpdel-core-map' from a keybinding:
(fset 'mpdel-core-map mpdel-core-map)

(provide 'mpdel-core)
;;; mpdel-core.el ends here
